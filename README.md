This “UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” will help the administrator to
maintain and refurbish all the records of a university . It can manage the records of
students by having all the information of a student like; name, age, birthdate, gender,
roll no, their department, and batch. And also, the courses and societies a student has
taken and a part of respectively. It can also manage the finance account of a student
like, amount of fee and its status. Can manage the records of staffs either regular or
visiting by having their name, staffID, email, designation, their qualification, the
department they teach in, and the university name(for visiting staff). The administrator
can manage and see all the departments and societies the university currently have.

providing necessary credentials for login and if he/she does not have an account then
they have to sign-up first to make an account and then login through their newly made
account credentials.
